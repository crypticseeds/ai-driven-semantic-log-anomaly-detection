Resume Bullet Points (You Can Copy)
AI Log Analyzer (FastAPI, LLMs, OpenTelemetry, Streamlit, Qdrant)
Designed and implemented an AI-powered log-analysis platform capable of ingesting live system logs, detecting anomalies, and generating LLM-driven root-cause analysis.
Built semantic search using vector embeddings (OpenAI + Qdrant) enabling natural-language querying across large log datasets.
Implemented anomaly detection models using PyOD (IsolationForest) with structured log parsing and clustering.
Developed a full observability stack (OpenTelemetry + Grafana + Prometheus) for tracing, metrics, and pipeline insights.
Delivered an interactive Streamlit dashboard visualizing log trends, anomaly timelines, and on-demand AI summaries.
